 Summary of tasks:
 
 In this computer project, we will study recommendation systems of the type that are used
 by, for example, Netflix. The objective of the recommendation system is to predict how
 much a user of the service would appreciate a certain movie and then recommend to each
 user those movies that the user is likely to enjoy. The prediction is based on how the user
 in question has rated other movies, and how other users have rated the different movies.
